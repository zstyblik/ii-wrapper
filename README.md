# ii-wrapper

Wrapper and a bot for [ii] IRC client inspired by and based on [iibot] by
[c00kiemon5ter]. Unlike the original, this one is leaning towards Python for
better or worse.

_Why?_ Why not? Bash, cURL, calc - all of these are dependencies in the same way
as Python and friends are.

ii v1.8 or newer(probably) is required due to change in log output format.

Features:

* commands
* configuration file in order to support multiple instances of bot
* auto reconnect

## UnLicense

Since the original is [UnLicense]-d, I've decided to follow the suit.
